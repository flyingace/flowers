      <h2>I. Early Methods</h2>
      <p>
        In April of 1990, I received a postcard from Jackson Mac Low. He and I
        had been writing back and forth intermittently following his having
        taught at the university I was attending. In his note, Jackson asked if
        I had copies of his French Sonnets or Words nd Ends from Ez, and if not,
        would I like him to send them to me? I didn’t have either of the books
        and soon wrote back to say that I’d love to have them. It wasn’t long
        after replying to his postcard that I began wondering about the books
        now headed my way. In the past I’d noticed that the titles of Jackson’s
        books or sequences often bore some relation not only to the content of
        the poems, but also to the methods he’d employed in writing them.1 I
        already knew something about Words nd Ends from Ez, having heard Jackson
        speak of these poems and having read the ones included in Representative
        Works: 1938-1985, but I’d never heard of French Sonnets, so I became
        especially curious about the book. What about the poems would be French?
        In what ways would they be sonnets? I looked in local book stores and in
        the university’s library but couldn’t find a copy of the book. While I
        was waiting for the books to show up in the mail I kept thinking about
        the poems, and I began to imagine several methods Jackson might have
        used in writing them. Later on that same month I decided I would put one
        of these imagined methods to use myself. Several years earlier I’d
        stolen my mother’s copy of Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal, an
        all-French edition2 put out by Doubleday in 1961. Opening the book I
        chose a poem at random: “Le Serpent Qui Danse.” Starting with the poem’s
        title, I went through The Random House Collegiate Dictionary looking for
        each of the words in the poem. Obviously, since I was using an English
        dictionary, I wasn’t able to find most of them. Instead I located the
        word that would have followed Baudelaire’s alphabetically, had it been
        in the dictionary. Once I’d located this English word I wrote it into my
        translation in the same location its French partner had occupied in the
        original. In this way in the title “Serpent” was replaced with
        “Serpent,” and “Danse” was replaced with “Dap.” I didn’t change proper
        nouns. When I located an English word for use and saw that it was noted
        in the dictionary as having French origins and that its spelling hadn’t
        changed when it crossed over to English, I substituted the word that
        followed it alphabetically in the dictionary.3 I began all this quite
        late at night and discovered that the method was rather time-consuming,
        so I went to bed with only the first two stanzas of the poem completed.
      </p>

      <h3>MWord</h3>
      <p>
        The next morning a second, faster method occurred to me. I realized
        that, rather than looking up each word in a dictionary, I could type one
        of Baudelaire’s poems—in French—into a word-processing program and using
        the “spell-check” feature allow the program to make English
        “suggestions” for each of the “misspelled” words. I could then choose to
        replace the French words with those suggested by the word processor. I
        selected Baudelaire’s “L’Aube Spirituelle” at random and typed it up
        using Microsoft Word v.3.0. I soon discovered, however, that when the
        program spell-checked the poem there were some French words for which
        the program wouldn’t offer an English suggestion. I went through the
        entire poem taking Word’s suggested substitutions whenever they were
        offered, but ended up with a series of lines written in both French and
        English. I translated the remaining French words directly into English
        using Larousse’s French-English/English-French Dictionary. The resulting
        lines were made up entirely of English words, but they lacked coherent
        syntax. At this point, in spite of my interest in using methods similar
        to this one as a way of getting away from the practices I’d employed as
        a poet up to that point, I didn’t feel completely satisfied with the
        result. My interest in having a strong hand in the poem and in narrative
        kept me from being content with the text as it stood. Later I came to
        think of this text—seemingly unconnected English words —as my “base
        text.” I used this “base text” as a sort of framework for the resultant
        poem. This isn’t to say that I would use each word from each line of the
        base text in strict order, but rather that I allowed the words to
        suggest lines of the poem to me, although individual words from the base
        text were sometimes directly incorporated. In this way the word “mess”
        in line 11 of “L’Aube Spiritually” comes from spell-checking the French
        “mes,” whereas my use of “electrifying” was suggested by “voltage,” the
        spell-checker’s substitution for the French “voltige” in the original.
        Much later, after I’d used this method a few times, I stopped using the
        French-English dictionary to translate words remaining in French after
        the spell-check was complete. Instead, I started translating these
        French words in a way which more closely resembled the As Understood and
        Free translation methods described below. After I’d written my first
        twenty translations I stopped using the MWord method much, though I did
        return to it from time to time when I needed to briefly change my
        practice.
      </p>
      <h3>Phonetic</h3>
      <p>
        For whatever reason, after writing “L’Aube Spiritually” I didn’t write
        another of these translations until late October of the same year. When
        I did decide to pick things up again I was nowhere near a computer.
        Since I couldn’t generate a base text using the familiar spell-check
        method, I chose to do so by trying to find English phonetic equivalents
        of Baudelaire’s French. Sounding out the words to “La Mort Des Amants”
        (which I’d again selected at random, of course4) I generated a base text
        of English words which, again, lacked any obvious syntax. I listened for
        English words in the sounds of individual words, strings of words, or
        any sequence of syllables in the words in Baudelaire’s lines. In this
        manner the beginning of the first line of “La Mort Des Amants,” “Nous
        aurons des lits…” was translated as “Noose orange delete.” Using these
        words as a jumping-off point, “An orange noose deleted…” became the
        beginning of the first line of “Law Morgue Days Almonds.”
      </p>
      <h3>As Understood</h3>
      <p>
        The next method that I came up with was far simpler than the previous
        two. I should back up a bit and say that when I began this project it
        had been about three years since my last French class. While my
        pronunciation might have been acceptable, there were large holes in my
        comprehension of French.5 In looking over several of Baudelaire’s poems
        however, I realized that I still understood a passable amount of what I
        was reading, and those words or phrases that I didn’t recognize were
        automatically assigned meanings, which they may or may not have had.6
        Not unlike a poorly prepared student translating a passage he’s never
        seen before from French to English in an exam, I tried to make sense of
        the poems in front of me. Since I was trying to translate the phrases in
        their entirety, I didn’t need a base text to work from. At this point I
        was more interested in understanding the language in Baudelaire’s poems
        than just the individual, isolated words.
      </p>
      <h3>Word List</h3>
      <p>
        The fourth method I worked out was only used in two of my translations:
        “Ember” and “Checkroom.” I made three lists of words (one list each for
        nouns, verbs and adjectives) chosen at random from The Random House
        Collegiate Dictionary. Each list had twenty-six words that began with a
        different letter of the alphabet, making a table three columns wide and
        twenty-six rows long. Taking Baudelaire’s poems “Elevation” and
        “Causerie,” I replaced the French nouns, verbs and adjectives with
        nouns, verbs and adjectives from my word lists. I chose words that began
        with the letter corresponding with the 1st letter of each French word.
        So “Elevation” became “Ember,” because “Elevation” was a noun beginning
        with E, and “Ember” was the word in the noun column’s E row. Adverbs
        were mostly translated as adjectives; prepositions and conjunctions were
        translated literally; and articles were translated as I judged
        appropriate, because “la vie” could translate as “life” or “the life” in
        different contexts. While my adherence to use of punctuation had varied
        in methods employed prior to “Word List,” the punctuation in both
        “Ember” and “Checkroom” mimics that of Baudelaire’s originals, and
        there’s probably also a close adherence to the sentence structures of
        the originals, due to the very nature of such a one-to-one replacement.
      </p>
      <h3>Free7</h3>
      <p>
        If it’s not already evident—after my confessing that I decided to use a
        word processor to find my French words’ nearest neighbors rather than
        search for the space they would each occupy in a dictionary—let me say
        straight out that I can become somewhat impatient as a writer.8 I found
        that as I translated poems As Understood or used the base texts
        generated with MWord or the Phonetic method, I wanted to move a little
        more quickly through the poems. New words and lines were suggesting
        themselves to me based on the meanings, sounds, shapes, possible
        meanings, and associations with the language in the French originals. So
        the Free method was developed by allowing myself to make use of these
        “suggestions” in what I came to think of as a “rapid jumping- off from
        the text.” While the translations I had made As Understood were written
        based on my best understanding of the poems, the Free translations
        responded more to characteristics of Baudelaire’s writing which were
        less obvious or overt. For example, the title of the poem “The Auto
        Mechanics,” translated Free from “L’Héautontimorouménos,” may have
        arrived as a result of the presence of “auto” in the longer French word,
        the length of the word and the other letters in Baudelaire’s title word,
        or perhaps something I am unaware of, to which I was responding. Since
        there is no grounding rule in the Free method, in the later translation
        work there was plenty of room to modify, respond or react both to modes
        of writing that I’d employed previously in the project and my experience
        of translating the poems. Free is the method used predominantly in
        Flowers of Bad, and there is no definitive version of it. Variations
        include Frigid, Frigidaire, Frozen, and Cracked. One poem was even
        translated using the Shazbot translation method. On the pages where I
        first wrote out my Free translations there are often notes like “What
        has Free become?” or “Free, but slowly,” or once or twice something like
        “Free-slurry.” There are probably numerous changes in my use of the Free
        method that could be noted if these translations were regarded
        chronologically, including breakdowns in syntax and in the one- to-one
        translation of words or images. Sometimes two or more meanings suggested
        themselves for lines or phrases in a poem, and rather than trying to
        figure out which of them was le mot juste, I would incorporate more than
        one, covering all my bets.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it’s true that many of the methods that came later were developed
        as direct responses to ones that had preceded them, I think of the
        creation of the of the first six methods (the discarded first one with
        the dictionary, MWord, Phonetic, Word List, As Understood, Free) as
        evolving more than responding. I say this because the development of
        each came more out of working with the previous methods and seeing other
        routes or possibilities than out of reacting against them in frustration
        or trying to find some way to get around problems that I’d come up
        against. The Free method grew mostly out of translating Baudelaire’s
        poems As Understood, although the other five methods contributed
        something to my use of it I’m sure.
      </p>

      <h2>II. Later Methods</h2>

      <h3>Collision & Directed</h3>
      <p>
        It has always seemed impossible to me to translate something without
        imposing some part of the translator’s own disposition. With this in
        mind, I decided that I wanted to intentionally choose a direction or
        attitude for a translation to adopt before I began composing it. The
        Collision method involved taking a poem of Baudelaire’s along with a
        second text, and translating the first either by using the second as a
        filter, or by smashing the two together during the translation. Somewhat
        similarly, the Directed method became another way of imposing a leaning
        or a tendency on a translation. In a Directed translation everything is
        interpreted in terms of a particular focus. If this focus were, for
        example, the object of one’s affection or a particular political agenda
        then it would be as if it were known that Baudelaire’s poem was in fact
        about the object of one’s affection or the political agenda. Any further
        understanding of Baudelaire’s poem would reflect this fact and this
        premise would be demonstrated in the translation of Baudelaire’s poem.
      </p>
      <h3>Blind</h3>
      <p>
        At some point I decided that I’d translated enough of Baudelaire’s poems
        that I felt as though I knew what he was doing, and I felt as though I
        understood pretty much what I was doing, so why not simply cut out the
        middle man? For the Blind translations I approached Baudelaire’s poem
        knowing nothing more at first than the line count and the title. Once I
        had written my translation I checked it against Baudelaire’s original
        and any parts of the poem that had been translated incorrectly were then
        corrected. (Remarkably, the handful of times that I used this method I
        found that my translations were pretty much dead-on and required very
        little correction.)
      </p>

      <h3>Forced Sonnet</h3>
      <p>
        In order to explain the Forced Sonnet9 method, it may be easiest to
        first describe the form of the resulting poem. The Forced Sonnets were
        translated from sonnets of Baudelaire’s. The translations all had 14
        lines, followed the same rhyme scheme and each line of the translation
        had the same number of syllables as the corresponding line in the French
        poem. I would begin by taking a translation I had done of one of
        Baudelaire’s sonnets using any of the other methods I’ve described up to
        this point (let’s call this the old translation). Then from the
        beginning of the first line of my old translation, I counted out a
        number of syllables equal to the number of syllables in the first line
        of the original French poem, and struck out all words on the line that
        came after. The words that remained became the first line of the Forced
        Sonnet. I then followed the same procedure with the second line of my
        old translation as I had with the first to produce the second line of my
        Forced Sonnet. Starting at the beginning of the third line of the old
        translation, I would look for a word which rhymed with what was now the
        last word of the first line of the Forced Sonnet. I then counted
        backwards from the rhyming word on the third line until I had reached a
        syllable count equal to the number of syllables in the third line of
        Baudelaire’s original. Only the syllables within that count made up the
        third line of the Forced Sonnet and I would strike out all others from
        the line. I then followed the same procedure to produce the fourth line
        as I had with the third, beginning by seeking a word in fourth line of
        the old translation which rhymed with the last word of the second line
        of the Forced Sonnet. Following this procedure I would now have a
        four-line stanza of two rhyming couplets, A-B-A-B. From here I would go
        on to produce the remaining rhyming couplets of the Forced Sonnet (i.e.,
        C-D-C-D E-E- F G-G-F). This is the basic method. However, there were a
        few contingencies I discovered I needed to plan for. Let’s suppose that
        I found a word in the third line of the old translation which rhymed
        with the end word of the new first line of the Forced Sonnet. Now let’s
        suppose that counting backwards from that word in the old translation I
        arrived at the beginning of the line before I have matched the syllable
        count of the corresponding third line of Baudelaire’s poem. In this
        instance I would wrap my syllable count around to the end of the line,
        continuing to count backwards from the last word of the third line of
        the old translation. The last syllable in that count would become the
        beginning of the third line in the Forced Sonnet and the rhyming
        word—where we started our count—would become the end of the third line.
        As an example, let’s say my first line of my Forced Sonnet ended with
        the word “these” and the third line of my old translation is “The
        batteries on the furnace climbing higher and higher until.” The first
        word in this line that rhymes with “these” is “batteries.” But if the
        third line in Baudelaire’s poem has thirteen syllables I’m out of luck,
        because counting backwards from “batteries” is only going to give me
        four syllables: “The batteries.” So I’ll get my remaining nine syllables
        by continuing to count backwards from “until,” the last word of the same
        line in the old translation. Counting backwards nine syllables I get
        “Climbing higher and higher until.” I’ll strike all remaining words or
        syllables from the line and put these nine syllables before my first
        four (still gotta have “batteries” at the end of the line to make the
        rhyme) and get as the third line of my Forced Sonnet: Climbing higher
        and higher until the batteries
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let’s suppose that there is no word in the third line of my old
        translation which rhymes with the end word of the first line of the
        Forced Sonnet I’m composing. In this case I would return to the first
        line of my old translation and re-write it by starting the syllable
        count from the second word in the line. This should produce a different
        end-word for the first line of the Forced Sonnet. So then I would return
        to the third line of the old translation and try to find a rhyming match
        again. If again no rhyming match could be found, I would return to the
        first line of the old translation and begin my count with the third
        word, repeating the process until a match had been made. Finally, it may
        have occurred to the reader that the odds are good that the syllable
        count might at some point fall in the middle of a word. I approached
        this issue both possible ways, by composing Forced Sonnets that included
        portions of words and by extending the syllable count in order to
        accommodate entire words. However, I never used both approaches in any
        one Forced Sonnet.
      </p>
      <h3>The Two Good Sisters</h3>
      <p>
        The Two Good Sisters method gets its name from both the title of the
        poem this method was first used with (“Les Deux Bonnes Sœurs”) and
        because the lines of a poem translated this way are separated in the
        middle by a short gap, creating a poem that may look as though it’s made
        up of two distinct but related parts, one right next to the other. In
        employing The Two Good Sisters, I would take a rectangular and opaque
        object (i.e., a magazine or a book) and lay it over a poem of
        Baudelaire’s so that the object’s leftmost edge ran vertically down the
        center of the poem, covering up the right half of the poem from top to
        bottom. I then translated (using any of my other methods) only what
        remained uncovered, including those words that were only partially
        visible. Once the entire first half of every line in the poem had been
        translated this way, I covered only the left half of the poem and
        translated the right-hand part of the poem which was now visible. From
        there, I lined the two halves of the poem up alongside one another with
        a gap of about five em spaces. With one or two of the translations I
        composed using The Two Good Sisters I merged the two halves together by
        removing the gap so they had the appearance of being made up of unbroken
        lines. In other instances I attempted to resolve the two mismatched
        halves of the lines so that they seemed to make more sense narratively;
        in others I didn’t, allowing them to make their own sense. Another
        variation of this form worth mentioning is The One Blind Sister, where
        one half of the poem was translated using The Two Good Sisters method
        and the other was translated using the Blind method (as explained
        above).
      </p>
      <h3>Exclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Somewhat similar in appearance, but not to be mistaken for The Two Good
        Sisters is the Exclusion method. The two might easily be mistaken
        because of a similarity in their appearances: both may include a visible
        split in the poem’s lines. The Exclusion method was accomplished in two
        stages. In the first stage of the translation process, I allowed myself
        not to feel bound to making use of all aspects of Baudelaire’s original
        poem. I took instead whichever parts of the lines I wanted and
        disregarded the rest. I tried, however, to insure that the result of
        this first stage would be a poem which would cohere narratively as the
        reader read in normal fashion, left to right, top to bottom. In the
        second stage of the Exclusion method I returned to the beginning of
        Baudelaire’s poem and wrote separate translations of the portions of the
        lines I’d excluded in the first stage, without trying to force the
        translated portions to reflect or cohere with any other part of the
        poem. Once the excluded portions had all been translated, I placed them
        next to the corresponding lines of the first part of the translation in
        italics, enclosed within parentheses.
      </p>
      <h3>Swimming</h3>
      <p>
        This may be the most difficult of the methods to describe exactly or
        specifically. I called the method Swimming because this is how I thought
        of it at the time: as swimming on the surface of the poem. Generally I
        would write out in French one of Baudelaire’s poems by hand, in blocks
        of about four to six lines. Then, using a different color ink, above or
        below the copied lines, I would write lines which somehow captured the
        mood of the French, while paying as little direct attention as I could
        to those qualities of the language that I had paid attention to in
        earlier methods (meanings, sounds, shapes, etc.). I repeated this
        process until all the lines from Baudelaire’s poem had been written out
        in French and translated in order.
      </p>
      <h3>Anagrammatic</h3>
      <p>
        I had intended for the Anagrammatic translations to be the last method I
        employed. By the time I reached the point where there were only five
        untranslated poems I had developed many feelings about the practice and
        process of translating, and about what I had and had not been able to
        accomplish during the long project of working with Les Fleurs Du Mal. I
        regretted that in my translations so many things had been added and so
        many things lost. I wanted somehow to make use of all of a poem without
        losing or adding anything. The closest that I came to this ideal may be
        in the Anagrammatic translations (there are 4), as every letter that
        appears in the original French poem also appears in the translation. No
        letters were added. These translations have titles which are anagrams of
        the French originals’ and every poem is a line-by-line anagram of its
        French counterpart. I didn’t retain any of the accents or cedillas, and
        letters such as œ were converted into o and e, but with these exceptions
        each line in the translation contains the same letters as the original.
        The first poem I translated using the Anagrammatic method used a variant
        that clearly follows the toughest set of restrictions, bordering on the
        Oulipian.10 In “A.M. Sequel,” not only is every line, dedication and
        epigram anagrammatic of the original, but the poem is made up of
        complete sentences which follow the rules of English grammar (although
        there continues to be some debate between my copy-editor mother and
        myself as to whether a single noun can be modified by two verbs without
        a conjunction). All of the Anagrammatic translations were written by
        laying out letters from the lines of one of Baudelaire’s poems using the
        tiles from two complete Scrabble™ sets and then re-arranging them. I did
        this steadily for about three and a half months in order to write “A.M.
        Sequel,” and then swore I would never take up this particular variation
        of the method again. As I’ve just written, when I began the Anagrammatic
        poems I had many complex feelings about translating and more
        specifically about translating Baudelaire. I also felt that composing
        false translations had often been a way of finding entry into a poem
        from which I was otherwise excluded. From time to time, however, I no
        longer wanted so much to find a way into the poems as to shatter them
        with a hammer. Though I tried to figure out just how this could be
        accomplished (“1. Write poem out on a sheet of glass. 2. Apply hammer as
        needed.”, etc.) I never fully succeeded. I do think, however, that the
        remaining three Anagrammatic translations (“Hep Slears,” “XLII” & “Er
        Irbralaple”) come closest to accomplishing this out of all the
        translations that I’ve done.11
      </p>
      <h3>Re-translation</h3>
      <p>
        There at the last though, I found that there were a few poems that I
        wanted to re-translate, although I found the methods that I’d used up to
        that point unworkable, perhaps because I was quite ready to be finished
        with the project. I tried working with the texts as they were, colliding
        them with alternate translations of the same poem, extracting words,
        etc. The results, however, were not terribly satisfying. Ultimately I
        ended up re-translating them, but without referring again to
        Baudelaire’s original. Two of these (there were three, I believe) were
        translated from English into English, using a method which probably owes
        something to the Swimming method. The third of these Re-translations I
        translated back into French. Having read all of Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs
        du Mal in one fashion or another, I had picked up or remembered a bit
        more French than I started with. If nothing else I might say that I felt
        a certain familiarity with the language, even if I wouldn’t be able to
        share that familiarity with anyone else by engaging them in a
        conversation.12 I decided that I would do my best to restore one of
        Baudelaire’s poems by re-translating it from English back into French in
        a way which may serve as the obverse of the As Understood method.
      </p>
      <h2>III. A Final Note On The Forms Of These Poems</h2>
      <p>
        With few exceptions I have managed from the beginning to retain several
        aspects of Baudelaire’s form in each of these poems. Firstly, almost
        every line in this collection begins with an initial cap, as do the
        lines in the edition of Les Fleurs du Mal that I have used throughout
        the process. For the most part I have also followed Baudelaire’s line
        breaks and stanza length. His sonnets remain sonnets here, at least in
        as much as they are fourteen-line poems in two four-line stanzas
        followed by two three-line stanzas.13 While all these poems were
        translated as whole and complete poems, the translations were done line
        by line, and the translated aspects or words from one line do not wrap
        around and appear on another that follows it. There are also those poems
        that retain the rhyme schemes of the originals, including some that are
        not Forced Sonnets.

      <p>
        In March of 1991, almost two weeks after I’d written “The Fin of the
        Journey,” the last poem in the first sequence of twenty poems from this
        series which would later be published as Flurries of Mail, a copy of
        French Sonnets that Jackson had sent arrived in the mail.

          1 The title of Words nd Ends from Ez, for example, mimics something of
          the appearance of the lines of the poems included in that collection
          where Jackson “systematically brought into Words nd Ends from Ez
          letter strings consisting of single words and/or ends of words [from
          The Cantos] that successively ‘spell out’ Ezra Pound’s first and last
          name ‘diastically,’ i.e., strings in which the letters of Pound’s
          first and last names occupy places corresponding to those they fill in
          the names.” [Words nd Ends from Ez, p. 89]

          2 The only other all-French book of poems that I had in my apartment
          at the time was Jacques Prevert’s Paroles. I imagine that this would
          now be a very different collection if I’d chosen to make use of it
          rather than Les Fleurs du Mal. You might very well be hold- ing a book
          right now entitled Parolees or Pay Roll instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          3 Which leaves us with the mystery of Serpent, which would seem to be
          a French word which hasn’t changed its spelling. Sixteen years later I
          seem to have lost track of my copy of The Random House Collegiate
          Dictionary, so I’m unable to refer back to exactly what it said.
          However, other dictionaries that I have in my possession at present
          indicate that “serpent” is Middle English in origin, and this may be
          why I chose to keep it in. Or maybe I ignored my rule or hadn’t come
          up with it before I started out writing the translation but found a
          need to apply it later on so developed it on-the-fly. Christ, it was
          only eight lines I got through that night. In any event I was probably
          quite tired and should be cut a small measure of slack for that reason
          if no other.

          4 Of course, choosing a poem “at random” usually meant opening the
          book somewhere near the middle and using whichever poem was on the
          right hand page, so long as it was- n’t too lengthy for however much
          time I wanted to spend writing right then.
        </li>
        <li>
          5 Maybe it would be good to include some note about how much French I
          speak now or had studied up to that point. I had taken about three
          years of French in high school, and was pretty fanatical about it. I
          loved studying French, and did very well with it. When I got to
          college I continued my studies, beginning with a French intensive
          class and then two more classes over the next two terms, the last one
          being a class in French phonetics and pronunciation. I left the
          university I was attending after that third term, largely because the
          academic mood was somewhat lacking there and my performance academi-
          cally had begun to slip at the end of my first year. I didn’t fail
          anything, but my studies of French weren’t really proceeding with the
          same vigor that they had when I was in high school. After I got to
          Binghamton, where I later studied with Jackson, I really didn’t feel
          much like continuing with my French studies. Just before I met
          Jackson, I had taken a term and a half of introductory Spanish, taken
          largely because I wanted to be able to bet- ter hear the language in
          Federico Garcia Lorca’s poems. As much as I may have wanted to return
          to my studies of French once I’d begun this project, I felt as though
          I should- n’t try to learn any more French as it would make the
          process of translating, especially with the As Understood and Free
          methods, that much more difficult. I have only ever read one paragraph
          of a quotation of Baudelaire’s in translation. I have a good under-
          standing of French grammar and at least a fair understanding of the
          phonetics (although I might not be able to get my tongue to work out
          all pronunciations as I would like it to). What is probably most
          lacking is my vocabulary. A somewhat more concrete example of how
          lacking or not my French is might be found in the poem “Blanche.”

          6 In explaining this process to people since, I’ve pointed out that
          this is the sort of thing that goes on all the time. I think that when
          people encounter language they don’t understand they automatically
          make some sense of it, even if they write these interpretations off
          because they don’t match the rest of their understanding.

          7 How shall I explain the Free method now as I hurtle towards Toronto
          in a train to visit my grandmother just before Christmas? Canada’s a
          strange place, where most of the prod- uct packaging (if not all, I
          haven’t inspected it all yet) is written out in both French and
          English. My earliest desires to study French arose out of a
          frustration with this country, where left to my own devices while the
          adults busied themselves with adult matters (all that talking!) I was
          allowed to sit down in my grandmother’s study and watch television. Is
          there some sort of metaphor for the Free process or for all of false
          translation in the fact that across North America it seems that the
          major television stations broadcast much of the same programming but
          at different times and on differently numbered channels? My
          grandmother’s house possessed a strange device known as a cable box. I
          don’t think that I’ve ever seen one outside of Canada like it. It was
          a small box, covered with buttons, each designated with a number and a
          few letters, probably including ABC, NBC and PBS, but all with the
          numbers wrong. Since all the stations were wrong, were not where they
          should have been, I had to punch through this series of buttons trying
          to uncover the code that would show me the sort of programming I most
          desired: cartoons. Because of the fervor with which I searched, I
          don’t think that it took too very long to locate a channel show- ing
          cartoons, but my discovery was accompanied by a powerful frustration.
          The cartoons were entirely in French. Bugs and Elmer were speaking,
          but the words that came out of their mouths were entirely
          incomprehensible to me. At that point I became determined to learn to
          speak French, so I could return to Toronto and understand the French
          cartoons. So it would be possible, I suppose, to argue that the
          origins of these false translations comes earlier than when I received
          Jackson’s post card. Fairly late into the project I began to see one
          possible way of interpreting this project as a struggle to find a way
          into a text from which I was otherwise excluded. Often enough, this is
          why I had to switch up or modify my methods, or develop new ones.
          After working with a method for a while I would find myself stalling
          out, I would worry that I was falling back on tricks or ways that I
          already knew would work, and the poems would no longer surprise me in
          the way that I wanted them to. I am reminded here, oddly enough, of
          the Star Trek villains The Borg, who could be hit by the Enterprise’s
          phaser blasts, but only for a couple of shots, at which point their
          shields adapted, and the phasers would no longer be useful. So the
          crew of the Enterprise found that they had to continually change the
          modulation of their phasers so that they would be able to fight off
          the Borg and resist being assimilated into their “col- lective,” an
          organization that thought with one mind, acted as one entity, had only
          one understanding. Although I wonder if this contradicts a statement
          by Walt Whitman that I’ve often also associated with these poems “The
          job of the poet to resolve all tongues into his own.” Though that’s
          “resolve,” and not “assimilate.”

          10 It’s ridiculous to assume that I’m going to be able to explain to
          you in full what the Oulipo is or what I mean by Oulipian here, so
          let’s abandon that as the goal of this foot- note. Rather I’ll refer
          you to a few other people’s words on the subject. In The Oulipo and
          Combinatorial Art (1991) Jacques Roubaud explains that the Oulipo is a
          group whose name derives from their “initial, inaugural name: Ouvroir
          de Littérature Potentielle” (Workshop for Potential Literature). He
          further goes on to explain that “The aim of Oulipo is to invent (or
          reinvent) restrictions of a formal nature and propose them to
          enthusiasts interested in composing literature.” Raymond Queneau’s
          definition is my favorite: “Oulipians: rats who build the labyrinth
          form which they plan to escape.” In short, when I say “borders on the
          Oulipian” I mean that the form I was using had sever- al rigid
          constraints which affected the resulting poem. In truth my constraints
          were more restrictive I believe than many of the methods created by
          the Oulipians, though certainly not as restrictive as some. La
          Disparition is a 300 page novel, written in 1969 by Georges Perec,
          entirely without the letter e. Its translation into English by Gilbert
          Adair, also entirely without the letter e, is entitled A Void. I first
          encountered the Oulipo around 1999, when Harry Matthews came to read
          at the St. Marks Poetry Project in New York shortly after the
          publication of Oulipo Compendium. I later wrote Mr. Matthews trying to
          learn whether my anagramatic method had already been developed by any
          members of the Oulipo. He assured me that it had not.

          11 Ironically this is done without losing any of the “shards” or
          “fragments” of the original.

        <li>
          12 I have been asked to include the following tale as an example of
          how well I actually speak French: Some years ago, on my first visit to
          France I went to Avignon in the South. While walk- ing across a bridge
          that spanned the Rhône and a small park on one bank I was distract- ed
          by a group of older men and women playing boules on the grass below.
          With my head turned to the side and not watching where I was going I
          walked straight into a lamppost and banged my head so hard that it
          made a loud “bong!” sound against the metal pole, not unlike the sound
          of a medium-sized bell being struck. When I recovered from the col-
          lision I could see that all the people down in the park below me had
          paused in their game and were now looking straight up at me, trying to
          determine what had caused the noise. Of course I knew that I was going
          to get a large bump on my head and thought that as self-conscious as I
          was being an American travelling alone in France, being an American
          travelling alone in France with a large egg-shaped protrusion on one
          side of his head would be far worse. I determined immediately that I
          needed to remedy the situation and set out in search of a bar. It was
          late afternoon and fortunately there was one open just past the end of
          the bridge. I walked in and got the attention of the bartender and he
          came over, staring fixedly at my growing lump. Now that I had his
          attention I asked him (in French) “Can I have some ice cream? I’ve
          just kicked myself in the head with a lamppost.”
        </li>
        <li>
          13 There are a couple of exceptions to this “sonnet rule” which were
          translated in reverse, from the bottom up, so the line order in those
          stanzas runs three-three-four-four, or where the line order within
          each stanza remains the same but where the order of the stanzas is
          reversed.
